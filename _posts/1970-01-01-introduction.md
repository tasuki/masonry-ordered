#Introduction

In case you haven't, you should start by reading the [introduction to jQuery Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/docs/intro.html). The usage of jQuery Masonry Ordered is almost same, this page highlights the few differences.

## Getting started -- markup

The only difference is that after including jQuery and Masonry, you need to include Masonry Sorted:

{% highlight html %}
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="/path/to/jquery.masonry.min.js"></script>
<script src="/path/to/jquery.masonry.ordered.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

## Repository / development

The repository of jQuery Masonry Sorted is at [github.com/tasuk/masonry-ordered](http://github.com/tasuk/masonry-ordered). There you can find the newest version, submit bug reports, or help with development.
